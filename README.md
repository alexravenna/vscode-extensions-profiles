In parentheses are those who proposed this idea:

- 💡 Apply a profile to a set of selected workspaces;
- ✅ Global profile ([drod3763](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-895592733), [jlongo](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-950224588));
- ✅ Import selected profiles;
- 💡 Multiple (combine) apply of profiles ([lakuapik](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-876195053));
- 💡 Recommendations for installing missing extensions;
- 💡 Convenient management of extensions for a separate project without linking to a profile or creating it;
- 💡 Create a profile from the current or selected project;
- ✅ Multiply delete profiles;
- 💡 UI to switch profiles, a dropdown box on the bottom status bar ([dnmalenke](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-1058163192)).
