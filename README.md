Lets you create profiles to include the selected extensions in the desired project.

Do you often have to work with different projects and different technologies?

My thoughts:

- 💡 Apply a profile to a set of selected workspaces;
- ✅ Global profile;
- ✅ Import selected profiles;
- 💡 Multiple apply of profiles;
- 💡 After installing new extensions, automatically add to the list of disabled extensions not specified in the profile;
- 💡 Linking the project to the profile (notification and application of changes when changing the profile);
- 💡 Recommendations for installing missing extensions;
- 💡 Convenient management of extensions for a separate project without linking to a profile or creating it;
- 💡 Create a profile from the current or selected project;
- 💡 Multiply delete profiles.
