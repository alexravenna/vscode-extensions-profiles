Lets you create profiles to include the selected extensions in the desired project.

Do you often have to work with different projects and different technologies?

My thoughts:

- 💡 Apply a profile to a set of selected workspaces;
- 💡 Import selected profiles;
- 💡 After installing new extensions, automatically add to the list of disabled extensions not specified in the profile;
- Привяз Linking the project to the profile (auto update when the profile changes);
- 💡 `ext-profiles.json` - local configuration file for projects and recommendations for installing missing extensions;
- 💡 More convenient modification of plugins for a separate project without linking to a profile or creating it;
- 💡 Create a profile from the current or selected project.
